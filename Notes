Responsive Web Design- Where the web page renders correctly on all the devices.

3 main ingredients of Responsive Web Design:
1. Fluid Grid- All layout elements are sized in relative units, such as percentage, instead of absolute units like pixels.
2. Flexible images: are also sized in relative units.
3. Media Queries: Allow us to specify different CSS style rules for diff browser rules.
